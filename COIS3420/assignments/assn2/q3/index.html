            <h1>Small API with my favourite products and their reviews!</h1>
            <h2>Description:</h2>
            <p>
                Learn about my tastes, find good products, and read my mostly unbiased reviews! 
                Also includes approximate pricing on each item (prices provided in Canadian dollars), and a final score!
                Use this API whenever, wherever you go for absolutely no payment!
            </p>
            <h2>Functions:</h3>
            <p>Currently supports three functions - I may add more for Assignment 3</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Find all products that I recommend</li> 
                <li>Read all reviews for all products I have</li>
                <li>Find all reviews for a particular product</li>
            </ol>
            <h2>Usage:</h2>
            <ol>
                <!--Read here that it's okay if the list item has paragraph: https://www.oxygenxml.com/dita/styleguide/webhelp-feedback/Artefact/Syntax_and_Markup/c_Paragraphs_within_List_Items.html-->
                <li>
                    <p>
                        Use the following URL with no input: readAllProducts.php, 
                        and get the products I recommend in a JSON encoding back.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        Use the following URL with no input: readAllReviews.php,
                        and get the reviews in a JSON encoding back.
                        It automatically clusters the reviews for one product together, 
                        so you get all information you need! 
                        Note: reviews can have a score of null, this simply means that the most recent score remains.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        Use findReviewByProduct.php and provide an ID of a product that you want reviews for.
                        This returns all reviews for a particular product, 
                        and allows you to make an informed decision about something!
                        Note: reviews can have a score of null, this simply means that the most recent score remains.
                    </p>
                </li>
            </ol>
