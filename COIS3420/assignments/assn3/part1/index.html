                The entire list is written in one line to avoid the problem
                of whitespace in DOM NodeList that this part's script relies on.
                The reference from MDN web docs mentions that there are several
                functions of JS that allow to avoid #text nodes, but in order
                to have a workable live NodeList, I chose to not use them. Link:

                    <p>
                        The Soviet Union, officially known as the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (USSR or СССР), was a federal
                        socialist state in Northern Eurasia that existed from 1922 to 1991. Nominally a union of multiple national Soviet
                        republics, in practice its government and economy were highly centralized. The country was a one-party state,
                        governed by the Communist Party with Moscow as its capital in its largest republic, the Russian Soviet Federative
                        Socialist Republic (Russian SFSR). Other major urban centers were Leningrad, Kiev, Minsk, Tashkent, Alma-Ata, and
                        Novosibirsk. It spanned over 10,000 kilometers (6,200 mi) east to west across 11 time zones, and over 7,200 kilometers
                        (4,500 mi) north to south. Its territory included much of Eastern Europe, as well as part of Northern Europe and all of
                        Northern and Central Asia. It had five climate zones: tundra, taiga, steppes, desert and mountains.
