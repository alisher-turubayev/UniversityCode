      <h1 class="centered">Assignment 3 - Essay on United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement</h1>
      <h3>Introduction</h3>
      <p class="justify">
        In this essay, I will present my own opinion on the controversial <em>Intellectual Property (IP)</em> provisions added to the <em>United States, Mexico and Canada Agreement (USMCA)</em>.
        <br>
        First, we need to establish an understanding of what the new <abbr title="United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement">USMCA</abbr> deal is.
        Back in the 2016 elections, Donald Trump, a then-Republican nominee, was constantly referring to <em>North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA)</em>,
        a USMCA predecessor, as a "worst trade deal ever"<a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2017/04/nafta-explainer-170427005642970.html">[1]</a>.
        When elected president, he committed to renegotiating <abbr title="North American Trade Agreement">NAFTA</abbr>, and on July 17, 2017,
        the Office of the United States Trade Representative released the Summary of Objectives for the <abbr title="North American Trade Agreement">NAFTA</abbr>
        renegotiations<a href="https://ustr.gov/sites/default/files/files/Press/Releases/NAFTAObjectives.pdf">[2]</a>. That document laid out key points that the
        Trump administration wanted to achieve, especially in the <abbr title="Intellectual Property">IP</abbr> protections.
        They include:
        <ol>
          <li>Ensuring that the protection of <abbr title="Intellectual Property">IP</abbr> is on par with US provisions;</li>
          <li>Preventing "the undermining of market access for US products" by using the law for <em>geographical indications (GI)</em>.</li>
        </ol>
      </p>
      <p class="justify">
        After a fierce year of negotiations, the new <abbr title="United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement">USMCA</abbr> deal was presented to the general public.
        It was branded as "<abbr title="North American Trade Agreement">NAFTA</abbr> 2.0",
        as it updated many of the old provisions that <abbr title="North American Trade Agreement">NAFTA</abbr> had.
        Governments of the three countries began then selling the deal to their people,
        as the agreement still must be ratified by the participants. Now is a good time to consider what is its' impact on the digital industry.
      </p>
      <p class="justify">
        As for the definition of <abbr title="Intellectual Property">IP</abbr> rights, they are, according to the Government of Canada's website<a href="http://international.gc.ca/trade-commerce/trade-agreements-accords-commerciaux/agr-acc/cptpp-ptpgp/sectors-secteurs/ip-pi.aspx?lang=eng">[3]</a>:
      </p>
      <blockquote class="justify">
        "rights that are given to persons over the creations of the mind, such as inventions (which are protected by patents);
        literary and artistic works (protected by copyright and related rights); designs; and symbols, names, and images used in commerce (such as trademarks)".
      </blockquote>
      <p class="justify">
        As mentioned above, the definitions of <abbr title="Intellectual Property">IP</abbr> are broad and includes many things, which, in turn, can and does create confusion over what is protected and what is not.
        However, because of the knowledge-based economy that most of the countries nowadays have, the protection of <abbr title="Intellectual Property">IP</abbr> rights becomes a very important topic,
        as it is a valuable tool in creating value. For example, patents that Apple owns on FaceID technology, their new authentication method on iPhones and iPad Pros,
        allows it to be ahead of their competitors, that cannot copy their process.
      </p>

      <!--Section on IP protection-->
      <h3>IP protections</h3>
      <p class="justify">
        As we turn back to <abbr title="United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement">USMCA</abbr>,
        we need to discuss what the new agreement does for those <abbr title="Intellectual Property">IP</abbr> rights protections in Canada.
        First and foremost, it lengthens the protection of copyright to 70 years after an author's death<a href="https://www.osler.com/en/resources/cross-border/2018/a-need-to-know-guide-on-ip-in-the-u-s-mexico-canada-agreement">[4]</a>.
        Canada has 2 and a half years to amend laws to comply with this change.
      </p>
      <br>

  	      </tr>
        </table>
      </div>
      <br>
      <p class="justify">
        For patents on biologics, most notably new medications, the protection will be lengthened to 10 years, from Canada's current 8<a href="https://www.osler.com/en/resources/cross-border/2018/a-need-to-know-guide-on-ip-in-the-u-s-mexico-canada-agreement">[4]</a>.
        Canada has five years to implement this change. Overall on patents, it also adds the restoration of patent term for delays of the Patent Office,
        which is completely new for Canada<a href="https://www.osler.com/en/resources/cross-border/2018/a-need-to-know-guide-on-ip-in-the-u-s-mexico-canada-agreement">[4]</a>. The Canadian government has 4.5 years to implement it.
        Additionally, it adds many other protections, but it is important to understand that almost all the provisions on <abbr title="Intellectual Property">IP</abbr> rights first saw the light in
        the <em>Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP)</em> agreement, before Trump's government withdrew from the negotiations. However, after the US withdrawal, many of those
        <abbr title="Intellectual Property">IP</abbr> protections were simply suspended to allow the US to return to the negotiations table, and the White House now talks about doing just that<a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trade-china-tpp-explainer/trump-says-us-could-rejoin-tpp-if-deal-improved-how-hard-would-it-be-idUSKBN1HN0TW">[8]</a>.
      </p>
      <p class="justify">
        Now, returning to the copyright protection extension. I believe that it is unnecessary, as Canada was already providing a long-enough protection
        of 50 years after an author's death. Increasing the protection by another 20 years means that it will take longer for the artistic works to become public domain,
        where anyone can change or reproduce original work. That, in turn, halts the overall productivity of the economy and destroys the creativity, and gives the gigantic corporations,
        like Disney or Apple, a massive amount of power to strike down anyone who even thinks of using their <abbr title="Intellectual Property">IP</abbr>. Case in point: the original Star Wars was released in 1977<a href="https://www.suiter.com/may-the-force-be-with-star-wars-intellectual-property/">[9]</a>,
        and is still protected under the copyright laws, which means that Lucasfilm (now owned by Disney) makes awful lots of money from licensing and does not permit the ordinary people and
        companies to create their own vision of the Star Wars franchise. Furthermore, the Lucasfilm owns the trademark on the word 'droid', which means that any company that wishes to use the word 'droid' in
        their movie must pay Lucasfilm to obtain the license on word usage or face a uphill legal battle.
      </p>
      <p class="justify">
        Looking at the extended protection for the biological drugs that I talked about earlier, I believe it will mean higher costs for the Canadians.
        As the protection of brand pharmaceuticals is extended to 10 years, the Canadian generic drugs industry will not have access to produce that drug,
        which means that the Canadian people and hospitals will have to buy expensive brand variety. I personally am against this provision, as I am currently
        on the generic drug called <strong>Quetiapine</strong>, which became a generic drug in 2017. I save approximately $200 a month on medications this way.
        The entire healthcare system of Canada saved more than $2.6 billion<a href="https://pharmascience.com/canada/about-generic-drugs-2/">[10]</a> by using the generic drugs.
        Additionally, I don't understand the arguments of the other side, as they claim that prolonged protection of the biological drugs will allow the company to present
        the medication quicker for the general public, as it will have more incentive to do so. This is not going to happed because the companies are already enjoying 8 years
        under the current law, so the 2-year extension will not cause much difference in pharmaceutical industry's policy.
      </p>
      <p class="justify">
        Another problem that I see in the new <abbr title="United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement">USMCA</abbr> <abbr title="Intellectual Property">IP</abbr> provisions is the stricter enforcement of <abbr title="Intellectual Property">IP</abbr>
        protections, which can mean that the so-called 'patent trolls' will have more power.
        Patent troll is a term that refers to the companies that do not create any new products or services; instead, they use their patents to sue other companies and create value to their shareholders<a href="https://www.eff.org/issues/resources-patent-troll-victims">[11]</a>. This halts innovation,
        creates legal challenges to small and big companies, as they are often forced to pay licensing fees to avoid litigation, and undermines the very idea of the patents, which were created to foster innovation.
        It became a plague in many developed countries, and to demonstrate that, we will take a look at the United States. A notable example of the patent troll is a company named <strong>Lodsys</strong>, which owns a patent on in-app purchases process, an essential part of many iOS and Android applications.
        In mid-2011, <strong>Lodsys</strong> started to sue small app developers, claiming that they were infringing their patents by having in-app purchasing system provided by Apple in iOS.
        These small developer teams had to settle the lawsuits, as the potential costs of a legal battle with Lodsys were unpayable for many of them.
        The problem of patent trolls is so problematic, that it "built" an entire city of Marshall, Texas, where 25% of all patent infringement cases were filed before 2017<a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2017-05-25/the-texas-town-that-patent-trolls-built-j34rlmjc">[12]</a>.
        Many technological companies, including Samsung, had their cases heard in the Marshall district court. Samsung even built an ice skate rink to win the people of Marshall over<a href="https://hbswk.hbs.edu/item/why-south-korea-s-samsung-built-the-only-outdoor-skating-rink-in-texas?cid=wk-rss">[13]</a>.
        Gladly for many companies, and sadly for Marshall citizens, the United States Supreme Court in 2017 unanimously ruled that the patent infringement cases now can be filed only in the district the company is founded or has the established place of business<a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2017-05-25/the-texas-town-that-patent-trolls-built-j34rlmjc">[12]</a>.
        Unfortunately, this case does not solve the problem of patent trolls, as they continue to terrorize the companies with lawsuits. This clearly illustrates that a good idea of patents can and is misused to halt innovation;
        therefore, the new provisions <abbr title="United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement">USMCA</abbr> has on <abbr title="Intellectual Property">IP</abbr> protections can actively hurt Canadian companies.
      </p>

      <!--Section on Data localization rules-->
      <h3>Data localization rules</h3>
      <p class="justify">
        We see another controversial topic in <abbr title="United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement">USMCA</abbr>: the data localization rules. In Article 19.12<a href="https://ustr.gov/sites/default/files/files/agreements/FTA/USMCA/19%20Digital%20Trade.pdf">[14]</a>, the agreement states:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
        "No Party shall require a covered person to use or locate computing facilities in that Party’s territory as a condition for conducting business in that territory."
      </blockquote>
      <p class="justify">
        Now, one might say that the rules give some flexibility: in Article 32.1(2) of <abbr title="United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement">USMCA</abbr>, the exceptions are given in the situations where the “public morals or … public order, … human, animal, or plant life or health, … privacy, and safety”<a href="http://www.michaelgeist.ca/2018/10/how-canada-surrendered-policy-flexibility-for-data-localization-rules-in-the-usmca/">[15]</a>
        are protected. However, it still is much stricter than the <em>Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTPP)</em>, which Canada is a part of. This essentially means that the countries in the <abbr title="United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement">USMCA</abbr> cannot force the
        companies to store data locally. Personally, I believe that is bad news for Canadian citizens, as corporations like Google, Amazon, and Apple can store lots of information abroad<a href="https://www.itworldcanada.com/article/usmca-round-up-how-it-affects-canadas-tech-sector/409510">[16]</a>, which makes it easier for a data leak to happen. Besides,
        Canadian authorities will have a harder time to access the data, as they will need to make an official request through the US government. I strongly think that the data localization should be allowed, and Article 19.12 be removed from the <abbr title="United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement">USMCA</abbr>.
      </p>

      <!--Section on CanCon-->
      <h3>Canadian Content</h3>
      <p class="justify">
        As for the Canadian content protection, it was a clear win for Justin Trudeau's government, as the original provisions from <abbr title="North American Trade Agreement">NAFTA</abbr>
        were kept in <abbr title="United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement">USMCA</abbr>. This means that the federal and provincial governments can put necessary policies in place to keep safe and develop
        "Canadian artistic expression and content, including in the digital environment"<a href="http://international.gc.ca/trade-commerce/trade-agreements-accords-commerciaux/agr-acc/usmca-aeumc/summary-sommaire.aspx?lang=eng">[17]</a>. I believe that the clause that allows the Canadian government to make new policies to protect the <em>Canadian Content (CanCon)</em> is going to help
        with the increasing problem of online broadcasting, as the new policies can be implemented to protect against that.
      </p>

      <!--Section on 'Notice-and-notice' system-->
      <h3>"Notice-and-notice" system</h3>
      <p class="justify">
        Another win for the Canadian negotiators was the preservation of <strong>"notice-and-notice"</strong> system for <em>Internet Service Providers (ISPs)</em> in Canada. Now, the US has the <strong>"notice-and-takedown"</strong> system for
        copyright infringement, that is, the <abbr title="Internet Service Provider">ISP</abbr> or content provider (YouTube, Facebook, Instagram, etc.) have to take down the content or restrict access to it upon receiving the notice from the owner<a href="http://www.entertainmentmedialawsignal.com/online-infringement-canadian-notice-and-notice-vs-us-notice-and-takedown">[18]</a>.
        Canadian system, on the other hand, employs different strategy: instead of taking the content down, the providers just need to notify the user who has posted the content online that they are infringing the copyright laws. This system therefore does not
        place any serious liability on the content providers (only if they don't provide the notice to the user; they are then liable for statutory damages between $5,000 and $10,000). I believe the Canadian system is much better than the US one, because the <abbr title="Internet Service Provider">ISP</abbr>s
        and content providers cannot be sued over copyright infringement and the companies do not have to implement automatic takedown systems.
      </p>

      <h3>Conclusion</h3>
      <p class="justify">
        Now, the <abbr title="United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement">USMCA</abbr> still needs to be ratified, and the companies and governments will have time to adjust to the new regulations. With the midterms for US Congress and Senate coming,
        we can see the ratification of <abbr title="United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement">USMCA</abbr> to be used as a political weapon. However, some experts say that the <abbr title="United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement">USMCA</abbr> is going to be ratified for sure, but definitely not this year<a href="https://business.financialpost.com/news/economy/intensive-tracking-of-u-s-congress-support-for-new-trade-deal-begins-one-analysis-finds-85-vote-shortfall">[19]</a>.
      </p>
      <p class="justify">
        In conclusion, the <abbr title="United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement">USMCA</abbr> provisions on <abbr title="Intellectual Property">IP</abbr> and digital trade are severe, but mostly expected, as they were seen before in the <abbr title="Trans-Pacific Partnership">TPP</abbr> negotiations.
        As the US is planning to come back to the <abbr title="Comprehensive and Progressive Trans-Pacific Partnership">CPTPP</abbr>,
        we can expect similar provisions added there as well. Now, is the deal good or bad for the Canadian content industry? Only time will tell.
