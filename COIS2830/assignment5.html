      <h3>Website Optimization</h3>
      <p>
        My website design was mobile-friendly from the start. The style.css file features one breakpoint:
        768px and wider, targeting desktops. I have consciously avoided adding a tablet breaker, as tablets only account to
        <a href="http://gs.statcounter.com/platform-market-share/desktop-mobile-tablet">5% of worldwide traffic</a>.
        I am using div tags for dividing the parts of my website (like div.header, div.footer and so on).
      </p>
      <pre>
        <code title="CSS code snippet - Device configuration">
          /* For mobile */
          ...
          @media only screen and (min-width: 768px) {
            /* For desktops */
            ...
          }
        </code>
      </pre>
      <h5>CSS code for desktop breakpoint</h5>

      <p>
        Resizing to a desktop from mobile centers the content, changes the image alignment and size.
        The text size does not change in terms of code. Another thing I have added for certain desktops
        is a custom scrollbar, that can be viewed if the page is loaded in Google Chrome or similar browsers.
      </p>
      <pre>
        <code title="CSS code snippet - Custom scrollbar">
          ::-webkit-scrollbar {
            width: 5px;
          }
          ::-webkit-scrollbar-track {
            background: #f1f1f1;
          }
          ::-webkit-scrollbar-thumb {
            background: #888;
          }
        </code>
      </pre>
      <h5>CSS code for custom scrollbar</h5>

        For load times on desktop, I have used a website called <a href="https://tools.pingdom.com/">Pingtom Tools</a>,
        and the result was 680ms for a user in Washington, DC. The performance grade given by the website was 82 out of 100.
        The biggest part of loading my website was on fonts, as I am using a custom font from
        <a href="https://fonts.google.com">Google Fonts</a>. The pictures on my website were compressed using
        <a href="https://compresspng.com/">Compress PNG and <a href="https://compressjpeg.com/">Compress JPEG</a>
        websites. The full performance report can be seen <a href="https://tools.pingdom.com/#59d3373c94000000">here</a>.
      </p>

      <p>
        For mobile load times, I have used <a href="https://testmysite.thinkwithgoogle.com/">Think with Google</a>
        mobile performance evaluation tool. The load time was 3 seconds on a standard 3G speed, and the website received a grade ‘Excellent’.
      </p>

        By using a changing navigation menu, I am reducing the number of clicks to do routine tasks (like logging in and contacting me).
        The links to assignments are located on the main page, so that the users can go the interested assignment right away.
        The current projects are available on both main page and resume, so that the potential employers will not have a hard time looking for them.
      </p>

      <p>
        As for optimizing the readability of the website, I have changed my white text shadow from grey to black,
        because it increases the contrast ratio of the text. I have also moved the shadow a bit to increase visibility
        on a colored background.
      </p>

      <p>
        In my small research into how the website is optimized for screen readers, I have discovered some points where my website was
        lacking in optimization. First, social media buttons were not optimized for screen reader, so I added a description on each button.
        Second, I found an <a href="https://webaim.org/techniques/css/invisiblecontent/">article</a> that talks about the invisible link
        to main content, and I have used that on my index.html and assignments page. It required adding a specialized CSS code to position the link left out of screen.
        Third, I have added <i>alt</i> attribute to all images in assignment 1 and assignment 2 for screen readers. Finally, I have added <i>title</i> attributes
        to <i>code</i> tags to describe the content inside of them.
      </p>
      <pre>
        <code title="CSS code snippet - Invisible link">
          #skip a {
            position: absolute;
            left: -10000px;
            top: auto;
            width: 1px;
            height: 1px;
            overflow: hidden;
          }
          #skip a:focus {
            position: static;
            width: auto;
            height: auto;
          }
        </code>

      <h3>Analysing Test Cases</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>
          There is no way for anyone to find the classroom directions without leaving the website,
          as the information is absent. Classfind, which does have directions to all classrooms at Trent,
          is not in any way linked on Trent website, so the user ends up bouncing around a couple of links.
          Unfortunately for Trent, the website search also does not reveal any useful information.
        </li>
        <li>
          On the first try finding the session dates for graduate studies I have accidentally arrived at
          Academic Timetable, which does not have the information I need. On second try, I clicked on <i>'Current Students'</i>,
          then <i>'Academic Calendar'</i> under <i>'Academics'</i>, and opened a <i>'Graduate Academic Calendar'</i>.
          There, on page 13, I found the required information. Search on site again yields no useful information.
        </li>
        <li>
          To find that Blackboard is accessible through myTrent portal, student first needs to click around the website and
          stumble upon the myTrent section by chance, where it says that the academic records are available on the portal.
          Alternatively, they can click on myTrent from the navigation menu. On the portal, there is no way to tell that the
          Blackboard system contains the grades for current classes, so the student bounces another couple of times until finally
          arriving at the Blackboard index page. There, it is easy to find the course and grades for that course.
        </li>
        <li>
          For HTML&CSS textbook, the second result in Google yielded the desired book on Amazon. However, the search results may vary,
          as Google tailors the result for a user. Also, the name of the textbook is common, as a lot of books talk about HTML and CSS.
          The second book, Design of Everyday Things was easier to find, because the name of the book is unique.
        </li>
        <li>
          As I live in Peterborough, ON, finding the Uber in Peterborough, UK is very hard. The only link that I could find about
          the UK city was Uber Estimator, which told me there is an Uber service and gave me a promo code. Trying different queries
          (<i>'order Uber Peterborough'</i>, <i>'Uber Peterborough order now'</i>) did not help. Only when specifying that I am looking
          for a ride in UK Google correctly gave me Uber's website with the possibility to sign up.
        </li>
        <li>
          For the analysis, I used <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ay4Znyz7Twc">this ad</a> by a Republican candidate for Congress.
          It is an attack ad on the Democrat candidate Jessica Morse. Using DuckDuckGo, I tried queries: 'is Jessica Morse is unbelievable ad true',
          'Jessica Morse attack ad true or not', and similar queries. Only the second query gave me a somewhat relevant result, but it was about a
          <a href="https://www.politifact.com/california/statements/2018/jul/24/jessica-morse/has-republican-congressman-tom-mcclintock-authored/">false claim</a>
          that she made on campaign trail.
