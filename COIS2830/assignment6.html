      <p>
        In this assignment, I chose to make a game in Arma 3 Eden Editor. The video below will discuss the implementation
        and some design choices that I have made, as well as demostrate the walkthough. The small essay afterwards will
        demonstate how I meet the assignment requirements.

      <h3>Point-by-point analysis</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>
          There is not much choice in my campaign until the last mission, where the player gets to lead a squad. The AI team
          leader gives waypoints to assist the player. As I have said in the video, my campaign is tailored for new players,
          so I give little variability in terms of playthrough. However, the player can refrain from following direct commands
          and just can charge at enemy. This tactic is, however, inefficient and puts the player at risk of losing, because there
          will be no fire support from the squad. In the last part, the player is given the full freedom, both in terms of
          loadout choice and in tactics. This increases the difficulty and makes campaign a little more interesting.
          At the end of the day, the focus is to teach the player on how to play Arma 3.
        </li>
        <li>
          The pacing is slow, because the target players are the ones who just started the game. For them, slow pacing will
          ensure the best understanding of the game mechanics.
        </li>
        <li>
          My campaign allows the player to experience all important parts of the gameplay: infantry/vehicle controls and squal
          leading. In the first part, I focus mainly on controls, allowing the player to use the vehicle. In the second part,
          it's more about the shooting part of the gameplay. Finally, the third part focuses intensely on the squad leading.
        </li>
        <li>
          My campaign is using the built-in models of CSAT, FIA and NATO forces. The season is summer, so all of the forces
          have camo. The vehicles are also colored accordingly.
        </li>
        <li>
          I am using increasing difficulty, paired with interesting game mechanics (squad leading) to create a joyful
          experience. As for the uniqueness, my approach is not that unique, because it is (kinda) used in the Arma 3
          campaign. However, I have paired it with playing for CSAT, which is not done in the included missions, thus
          creating a nice gaming experience.
